## SegmentationLoanProduct - ML-based Loan Product Segmentation

Welcome to the SegmentationLoanProduct repository, an innovative project employing machine learning clustering algorithms to design tailored loan products. This project aims to revolutionize how financial institutions approach loan product design, using data-driven insights to meet diverse customer needs more effectively.

### Project Description

SegmentationLoanProduct utilizes advanced machine learning techniques, particularly clustering algorithms, to segment potential borrowers based on various financial and demographic factors. By understanding these segments, the project assists in the creation of loan products that are more accurately aligned with the unique characteristics and needs of different customer groups.

### Key Features

- **Data Analysis and Preprocessing:** Techniques to clean and prepare data for clustering.
- **Clustering Algorithms:** Implementation of ML clustering algorithms like K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, and DBSCAN.
- **Segmentation Insights:** Analysis of the resulting segments to inform loan product design.
- **Interactive Visualizations:** Tools to visualize data and clustering results for better understanding and decision-making.
- **Simulation of Loan Products:** Framework to simulate the performance of designed loan products based on identified customer segments.
